Welcome to Signed documentation!
===================================

**Signed** is a twitter-like social network owned and controlled by its users.
It uses the same cryptographic algorithms to sign messages as bitcoin uses to sign transactions.
Because each message is signed by the source, the followers may verify the authenticity of the message regardless of 
how this message was delivered.

Check out the :doc:`faq` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` .
